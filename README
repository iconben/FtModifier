## Overview
This is a simple win32 utility program used to modify the creation time, last write time, or last access time of files. Currently the display language is in simplified Chinese.

## How to Use:
Please just click the FtModifier.exe to open the program, the UI is quite intuitive. You can select a file or multiple files, choose which time you want to change, then you can set the new value to either a fixed date time or a random date time that is between a certain range.

## Bug to Fix:
The creation time cannot be saved to the edited value, it always turns to the time at which the file was saved.

## Tests
The program was tested under Window XP, Window 7. It should run under Windows 10, Windows 11.

## Develop
Developed under Visual V++ 6.0 with MFC support. Any pull requests are welcome.
